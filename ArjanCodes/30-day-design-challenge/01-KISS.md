# Challenge: KISS

Tasks:
1. Count the frequency of each type of fruit and return a dictionary where the keys are the names of the fruits and the values are their respective counts. 
2. After completing the function, write tests to ensure that it's working correctly.
3. After you've completed the tasks, reflect on your solution and ask yourself the following questions:
	1. Is your solution as simple as it could be, or is there a simpler approach?
	2. Does your solution use language features and constructs appropriately and effectively?


   Write a Python function named ``count_fruits`` that accomplishes this task ``in the simplest possible way``. Follow the ``KISS`` principle to avoid unnecessary complexity in your solution.
   
2. The [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle -> **"Keep it simple, stupid!"**
	1. that simplicity should be a design goal
	2. Variations on the phrase  include
		1. "keep it super simple",
		2. "keep it simple, silly",
		3. "keep it short and simple",
		4. "keep it short and sweet", 
		5. "keep it simple and straightforward",[5]
		6. "keep it small and simple",
		7. "keep it simple, soldier",[6]
		8. "keep it simple, sailor",
		9. "keep it simple, sweetie",[7] 
		10. "keep it stupidly simple", 
		11. "keep it sweet and simple".
